* Helium

Helium is a prototype of a lightweight, instant-messaging-focused
Matrix client. **It is currently incomplete and unusable**, but might
someday be worth your time.

** Why?

Why not [[https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web][Hydrogen]]? Or any of the multitude of other clients? For
starters, this is an excuse to explore the nitty-gritty of the Matrix
API. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it's an opportunity to
play with the UI and UX that comes with writing a chat client.
